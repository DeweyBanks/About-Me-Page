		<h3>The Story of Michael Hall</h3>
		<p> Hello, my name is Michael Hall.  Thanks for stopping by!  I was born and raised in a small mountain town in North Carolina.  I grew up loving to perform and make people laugh.  As a child, I created my own talk show by interviewing my friends and the people in my neighborhood.  I would talk them into either telling a funny story or singing a song.  As I grew up, my love for entertaining grew as well, and in 2000, I graduated from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington with a Bachelor's Degree in Theatre Arts. In 2002, I moved to New York to perform stand up comedy full time. I perform under my Great-Grandfathers name: Dewey Banks.</p>

		<h3>The Story of Michael and Amy</h3>
		<p>This is me and my lovely wife Amy. I met Amy about eight years ago.  We quickly became best friends, and it wasn't long until we fell in love.  We were married in September 2010.  We are expecting our first child in August 2014, and I couldn't be more excited about it!. Amy runs a children's theatre with her friend Sam.  I built them a very basic website to help them promote their theatre.  You can check it out here: <a href="http://actinglikeakidnyc.com/">Acting Like A Kid!</a></p>

		<h3>The Story of Michael &amp; Festus</h3>
		<p>That's me on the right. The other handsome gentleman is Festus.  I met Festus five years ago when he came to live with my mother. They live in my hometown of Burnsville, NC. in a little neighborhood called Lickskillet.  Festus plays a very important role in Lickskillet.  Several years ago, the wolf was re-introduced to the Appalachian Mountains, and under protection from the government, their population has flourished.  This is great news if you're a fan of the wolf...not such good news if you're an elderly horse, just trying to live out your final days in peace.  That's where Festus comes in.  Donkeys are fiercely loyal and will fight to protect their family.  As far as donkeys go, Festus is one of the best!</p>
